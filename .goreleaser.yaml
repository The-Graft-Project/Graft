    ## Major Feature Update with Graft  🚀
    
    This release introduces significant enhancements to Graft, moving from basic local-to-server deployments to a more robust CI/CD-driven workflow using GitHub Actions and our new `graft-hook` service.
    
    ### Key Highlights:
    1. **Git Remote Modes**: Move away from direct local-to-server channels. Deployments now go through GitHub Workflows and CI/CD channels.
    2. **Graft-Hook**: A new webhook service personalized specifically for Graft-based servers, maintaining a zero-config solution with proper security.
    3. **Automated GitHub Workflows**: Graft now generates production-ready workflows automatically from your `graft-compose.yml` context.
    4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Easy CLI-based monitoring for `graft-hook`, including real-time build error logs.
    5. **Bug Fixes & UX**: Numerous performance improvements and user experience refinements.
